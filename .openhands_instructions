When resolving issues in this repository:

1. Focus on maintaining the existing code style and architecture
2. Files do not contain line numbers. If you see line numbers, it is due to the formatting of the tool reading the file (e.g. `cat -n`). Do not include line numbers in arguments for commands like `str_replace`.
